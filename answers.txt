1. Didn't need sudo for node because it doesn't need root privileges
2.lab.js is reading the plain text using the readfile then it prints it to console.
3. The after readFile is because readfile is aynchronous and this allows the the program to continusly run and execute without the need to wait for file to load
4. The toString translates the file to from raw to string so it could be readable
5.The browser should know how to read because of Content-Type
6.I would think there is some type of extension/code/module that has ability to map the right content-type
7. To combine the abiliy to send static files and respond to requests should be done by routing the url.
